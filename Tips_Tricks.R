## Need to set your working directory
## Simon showed me you can tab complete your working directory
## This is the best thing ever

## Other packages we need

## the package devtools is a good package to get and install packages
## That are not on CRAN

## install.package('devtools', dependencies = T)
## library(devtools)
## install.github("thomasp85/patchwork")
## install.github() installs packages from github repositories
## This should work to get the patchwork package installed
 
library(patchwork) ## load the package

## If you cannot get patchwork installed:
## Cam Nugent showed me the package cowplot, which is a good alternative
## to patchwork. It's on CRAN. 

## install.package('janitor', dependencies = T)
library(janitor) ## load the package

## Check out the data we're using. 
## mtcars is a free and publically available dataset
head(mtcars)
str(mtcars)

# Two functions that help out so much as rename and arrange
cars = mtcars %>% ## pipe the data to the functions
    ## saves time later on, don't have to specify the data for every function
  as_tibble() %>%  ## I've grown to love tibbles, so we'll make the dataset one
  arrange(hp) %>% ## Sort the dataset by number of amount of horse power 
  rename(`STALLION POWER` = hp) %>% ## change the name hp (horse power) to something better
  mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl)) %>% # changes column to a factor
  clean_names('screaming_snake') ## makes all of the name styles uniform
  
str(cars) ## Double check everything is how we want it

cars %>% ## pipe data to group_by to group data by cylinder
  group_by(CYL) %>% 
  do(model = lm(MPG ~ STALLION_POWER, data = cars)) %>% 
  ## The do() function is a neat way to link base functions to 
  ## dplyr functions. For example, running a linear model
  broom::tidy(model) ## the tidy functions within the broom package
  ## This is a great way to visualize the results of the linear model


## graph these relationships

## graph the relationship between miles per gallon and horse power

## Put the two graphs side by side
g1+g2
## Put the two graphs overtop of each other
g1/g2
